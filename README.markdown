# Design Patterns

## Aim
To go through the book Head First Design Patterns, but to use Ruby instead of Java.

## Books
* Head First Design Patterns
* Design Patterns
* Ruby Design Patterns

## Tests
I would normally use shoulda for testing, but it may make some sense to try cucumber and rspecs on this project. Just to learn. :)
